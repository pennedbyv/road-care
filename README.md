# 🚧 RoadCare – Solapur Smart Roads Platform

RoadCare is a civic-tech platform designed to help citizens report road issues such as potholes, cracks, and damaged surfaces through a simple digital interface (mobile app / WhatsApp bot / web form). The system collects geo-tagged reports with images and routes them to authorities through a centralized dashboard for faster resolution and transparent tracking.

This project focuses on improving urban road maintenance, increasing citizen participation, and building trust between the public and local authorities — with special focus on real problems faced in Solapur city.

## 📌 Problem Statement

Road damages often go unreported or are resolved slowly due to:
- Lack of easy reporting channels
